Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! Here, I am going to share my learning journey as I build a new website.

## What I have achieved

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.

2. **Creating Pages**: Then I learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **Post Creation**: This is my first post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

## Next steps

I'll finish the Astro tutorial, and then continue adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.
